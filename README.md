# Bear Help Desk

Bear Help Desk is an IT Support Ticket Management System where users can submit IT Support Tickets and employees can access and work with those tickets.

## Requirements

---

You will need the latest versions of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to run BearHelpDesk correctly. To check whether you have the correct versions, run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
 ```

```bash
 npm-v
```

## Setup

---

You can utilize this repository by one of the two ways:

1. Downloading the source code directly from this [link](https://github.com/rileygrotenhuis/BearHelpDesk)

2. Cloning the repository using your preferred Command Line Interface and running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rileygrotenhuis/BearHelpDesk.git
```

> Note: Whether you choose to download, or clone, this repository, it is preferred that you do so inside of your `documents/` directory.

> Note: If you download the code directly from GitHub into a `.zip` file, you will need to rename the folder from `BearHelpDesk-master` to just `BearHelpDesk`.

## Usage

---

1. Open your preferred Command Line Interface (Terminal, Command Prompt, iTask2, PowerShell, etc.) and change your directory until you are in the project folder

```bash
cd documents
cd BearHelpDesk
```

2. At this point, you can now run the following commands in your Command Line Interface to run the BearHelpDesk application:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

> Note: Once you run this application, you can access it at http://localhost:3000/

## Notes

---

This project currently does not have a list site to where you can test it. I am hoping to change this in the future as I am hoping to include a testing site for all of my personal projects that will be connected to my Personal Portfolio Website, but as of now you must run this project locally.
